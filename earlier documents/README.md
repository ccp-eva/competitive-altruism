# Competitive Altruism Power Analysis

## Instructions for power analysis

The power analysis should help us to predict whether differences between dyadic and triadic offers are significantly reliable as a function of:

* the number of trials administered
* the number of individuals (and formed triads) that participate

## Expectations:

### Individuals 

We will conduct this power analysis only for the A chimpanzee group.
I expect to test 6 chimpanzees (minimum expected to start study is 3, realistic maximum is 8).

Ages of the individuals that could participate: **28yo (Sandra), 27yo (Frodo), 18yo** (Tai), 45yo (Robert), 40yo (Dorien), 45yo (Fraukje), 17yo (Kisha), 20yo (Bambari). In bold those that I really count with.

If 6 individuals participate, I expect to create 6 unique triads. The idea is that each individual will participate twice as proposer and once as responder. 
If 4 individuals participate, I will try to create 4 unique triads so that each individual can still participate twice as proposer and once as responder.


Taking 6 individuals and 6 tryads as the most common outcome, I will perform a total of 768 trials.
Each triad will participate in 16 sessions (128 trials). There are no role changes within the 16 sessions.
Each session will present 8 consecutive or simultaneous trials.

### Variables

**Dyadic/Triadic condition**. Each triad will participate in 8 triadic sessions and in 8 dyadic sessions. We will alternate each type of session until we complete the 16 sessions.
  During triadic sessions the two proposers will make an offer to a responder.
  During dyadic sessions each proposer will make offers separately, while the other proposer will not be able to access the apparatus.

  In triadic sessions, 8 triadic trials separated in two blocks: consecutive and simultaneous trials (see below). Block order changes between sessions.
  In dyadic sessions, 8 dyadic trials separated in two blocks: four dyadic trials per proposer, one after the other. Block order changes between sessions.
  Always same responder within sessions (for the entire 16 sessions).
  
**Consecutive/Simultaneous condition**. Within triadic sessions, we will separate trials in two blocks containing simultaneous or consecutive trials. Only during simultaneous trials both proposers make an offer at the same time. Within consecutive trials, each proposer is first in two of the four trial blocks.

**Experience phase**. Assuming 6 individuals and 6 total triads, we expect that each individuals would participate in 3 triads, twice as proposer and once as responder.
  ABC design to test whether changes of partner (proposer and responder), affects individuals' strategies. 
  
  
  ***Alternative to also assess: It would be nice if we could manipulate whether only proposer changes and only responder changes. For example, with 6 individuals there would        be 4 proposers and 2 responders so that each proposer can be tested with different responder only, different proposer only or both different (e.g. A prop, B prop, C resp/      A prop, E prop, C resp/ A prop B prop F resp and A prop, D prop and F resp). This will create a total of 8 distinct triads.*** 

### Parameters to introduce

**Dyadic/Triadic condition** 
  In dyadic trials I expect individuals to behave as rational maximizers given previous studies in this population (Jensen et al 2007, Kaiser et al., 2012). For instance, in     Jensen et al 2007 chimpanzees offered 8 for self and 2 for partner in 54% of trials when alternative as 10 for self and 0 for partner. In Bueno-Guerra et al., 2019             chimpanzees prefer to maximize 6 for self and 0 for partne over 5 for self and 3 for partner in 70% of trials.
  
  Therefore, the expectation is that in a free-choice paradigm in which proposers can choose between 0 and 8 rewards for their partners, chimpanzees will tend to maximize.
  In dyadic trials we expect a mean offer of 1.2 offer with a SD of 0.4 (95% of data between 0.4 and 2).
  
  To my knowledge there is no study testing whether offers in an Ultimatum Game would increase in a triadic situation in chimpanzees. However, human literature (Roth et al.,     1991) shows that increasing the number of proposers increases the mean offer.
  Therefore, in triadic trials we expect a mean offer of 3.5 with a SD of 1.5 (95% of data between 0.5 and 6.5). I think the SD should be higher because here the offers depend   on both individuals propensities towards altruistic offers. If one proposer is not altruistic, the partner may offer just a bit more to be selected).
 
**Consecutive/Simultaneous condition**
 Effect only in triadic trials. The expectation is that consecutive trials would allow individuals to better focus on their own offers and on the offers of their partners. 
 Therefore we expect an offer increase in consecutive trials.
 In consecutive trials we expect a mean offer of 2.5 with a SD of 1 (95% of data between 0.5 and 4.5)
 In simultaneous trials we expect a mean offer of 4 with a SD of 1.5 (955 of data between 1 and 7)
 
 **Experience**
 We expect a mild effect of experience. In general chimpanzees change their strategies with time. They learn the strategies of the games (e.g. Sanchez-Amaro et al., 2016,        2017). However, in a recent pure-coordination task chimpanzees chimpanzees learned how to coordinate, but they did not improve coordination across partners (Duguid et al.,      2020). Still, I expect a small increase in the average offers across partner due to the competitive nature of the design.
 Across triads (and only within triadic situation) I expect an increase of 1 offer, maintaining the same SD. I do not expect increases in offers between dyadic pairs.
 
 **interaction dyadic/triadic and experience**
 I expect an interaction between the two conditions in the sense that offers increase with experience but only in triadic sessions. 
 
 
 
 **I would like to know, given a range of individuals between 3 and 8, how many trials will I need to get significant results if differences between offers in dyadic/triadic condition are of one, two or three for example.** The 768 trials is my approximation given the design I am currently proposing.
 **I would also like to know the same type of information if instead of e.g. 6 indviduals exchanging roles across sessions, only 4 of 6 change as proposers and the other two are responders (the alternative above).
